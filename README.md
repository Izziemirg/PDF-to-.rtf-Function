Azure Function App: Footnote Extractor

Overview:

This Azure Function App processes documents to extract footnotes from wherever they appear and replaces their superscript references with an inline notation: [Footnote X: ...]. The extracted footnote text will remain in the same exact location as their original superscripts.

Features:

Parses documents to identify and extract footnotes.

Replaces superscripts with the corresponding [Footnote X: ...] notation.

Maintains document structure and spacing integrity.

Supports only document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX, RTF). Although I would only recommend running it on PDF documents.

Prerequisites:

Azure Account with Function App support.

Python 3.8+ installed.

Visual Studio Code with the Azure Functions extension.

Git installed for version control.
